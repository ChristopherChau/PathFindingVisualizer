## Overview
Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool designed to visualize and compare various pathfinding algorithms. Users can input a grid and watch as algorithms such as Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS solve the problem of finding the shortest path from a start to a goal. This project was built to help me reinforce my understanding of these algorithms after learning them from my classes. 

## Why I Built This Project

I built this project for the following reasons:

- **Learning Algorithms**: I wanted to reinforce my learning of pathfinding algorithms by seeing their step-by-step execution in a visual format.
  
- **Learning Web Development**: This project was a very brief introduction to help me learn the basics of React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by building an interactive visualization tool. Prior to this project I had never used React, HTML, nor CSS so it was a great introduction in my opinion.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**: Users can draw walls, or add weights (Dijkstra feature only because it deals with weighted graphs), and set a start and end point. Users can also change the speed at which the algorithm is visualized.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Includes Dijkstra, BFS, DFS to calculate the shortest path.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm progress step by step as it finds the optimal path.

## Disclaimer

This was one of my first projects, and at the time of its initial development, I was only introduced to these 3 algorithms and I was still learning best practices and conventions for the framework. While I have since revisited the code to slightly clean it up, some areas may still benefit from further refinement and optimization. I welcome any feedback to help improve this tool.
